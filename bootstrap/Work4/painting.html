        <h2>Monalisa:-Leonardo Davinchi</h2>
        <p>The Mona Lisa (/ˌmoʊnə ˈliːsə/; Italian: Gioconda [dʒoˈkonda] or Monna Lisa [ˈmɔnna ˈliːza]; French: Joconde [ʒɔkɔ̃d]) is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about,the most parodied work of art in the world".The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression,the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,the wife of Francesco del Giocondo.It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice Salaì. It has been on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world.</p>

        <h2>The Economist:-Michelangelo</h2>
        <p>This is the story of three great cities of the Italian Renaissance, two exceptional artists and one revolutionary new medium. Michelangelo Buonarroti was from Florence, where drawing disegno was considered the father of all arts. Sebastiano del Piombo, ten years younger, came from Venice, where cross-continental trade brought rare minerals and pigments to artists who became masters of colour colorito. The two men met where all roads meet, in Rome.They were thrown together by the disruptive power of a new technique: oil painting. Italian artists had been slow to adopt this method, which had been widely used in northern Europe since the early 15th century. The quickest on the uptake were the Venetians, who used it to create a depth and lustre of colour unimaginable with quick-drying egg tempera or fresco. Sebastiano had mastered it; Michelangelo struggled. His solution was to work with the young Venetian.</p>

        <h2>Guernicca:-Picasso</h2>
        <p>Guernica (Spanish: [ɡeɾˈnika]; Basque: [ɡernika]) is a large 1937 oil painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.It is one of his best-known works, regarded by many art critics as the most moving and powerful anti-war painting in history.Guernica is exhibited in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid.The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) across, portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.Picasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country town in northern Spain which was bombed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy at the request of the Spanish Nationalists. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish display at the 1937 Paris International Exposition, and then at other venues around the world.</p>
